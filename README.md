# Growth assay analysis

In this project we try to compare growth rate of different yeast strains in different media
In this experiment, measurments of 4 96-well plates were taken every 30 minutes, for total of 110 measurments (54.5 hours) for each plate

raw data.rar - contain raw measurmwnt files (110 files for each plate)
GA conditions.xlsx - contain the condition (strain and media in each plate)

2 models were used:
logistic curve fit.ipynb - fitting data to log curve
4PL model.ipynb - fitting data to 4 parameter log curve

For each model, we compare the parameters of the fitted data to determin the difference between the yeast growth under the different conditions
